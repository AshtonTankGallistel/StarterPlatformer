**Starter Platformer**

Deliver a letter to a family of snowman up a mountain!

Created for my section 6 assignment in CMPM 120.

Built using a Phaser 3 code framework for creating a bare-bones 2D platformer game.

Visual assets provided by Kenny Assets [Pixel Platformer](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer) asset pack, with gratitude.
